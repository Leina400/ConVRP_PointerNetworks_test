# ConVRP - PointerNetworks 
Exploration of a Pointer Networks-based approach combined with an Actor-Critic model for the Consistent Vehicle Routing Problem (ConVRP). The code was adapted from the VRP Pointer Networks implementation available at https://github.com/OptMLGroup/VRP-RL

This is exploratory work conducted in early 2025, aiming to experiment with deep learning models and a reinforcement learning approach. The results and methodology are preliminary and require further validation.

You can find in this repository my project report, including the results, challenges, state-of-the-art review, and more.

### How to run  :
`exemple : python trainer.py --task=vrp --nodes=10 --train-size=512 --valid-size=64 --batch_size=64`
